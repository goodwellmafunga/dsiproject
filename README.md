# Currency Exchange Rate Prediction Project

Welcome to my Currency Exchange Rate Prediction project! This project is a part of my data science class and focuses on predicting currency exchange rates using web scraping and machine learning techniques. The project utilizes data from Yahoo Finance, and the results can be explored through my interactive web application.

## Project Overview

In this project, I aim to predict currency exchange rates by leveraging historical data available on Yahoo Finance. I employ web scraping techniques to collect relevant data, and my machine learning model utilizes this data to make predictions. The model is designed to provide insights into potential future trends in currency exchange rates.

## Web Scraping Yahoo Finance Data

To gather the necessary data, I implemented web scraping on Yahoo Finance. The scraping process collects historical currency exchange rate data, which is then used for training and evaluating my machine learning model. I have taken care to ensure the legality and ethicality of my web scraping approach.

## Machine Learning Model

My predictive model is built using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The model has been trained on historical exchange rate data to make accurate predictions about future rates. I continuously strive to improve and refine my model to enhance its predictive capabilities.

## Explore My Model

To interact with my model and explore its predictions, please visit my web application [here](https://dsiproject.streamlit.app/). The web application provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to input parameters, visualize predictions, and gain insights into currency exchange rate trends.

## How to Run Locally

If you wish to run my project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/currency-exchange-prediction.git
   cd currency-exchange-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will start a local server, and you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.
